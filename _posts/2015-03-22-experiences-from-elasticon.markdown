I was sitting at my desk on a Friday when my boss sent me an email about Elastic{ON} asking if I would be interested in attending, and of course I immediately jumped at the opportunity.

Conferences are a great way to recharge and get inspired by meeting people and hearing about the latest and greatest. That’s what the dev community is all about! Here’s my experience:

# Arriving to San Francisco
San Francisco is a beautiful city with endless opportunities to explore. I started taking pictures as soon as I arrived and posting them to the Elastic{ON} app - the app by the way was a fantastic idea. Everyone was interacting long before we ever made it to the kick off party. From the Embarcadero, to Alcatraz island, to the top of Coit Tower and over the Golden Gate Bridge I logged over 1000 photos and have countless amazing memories. 

# Ok, The conference
If I had to describe the conference with one word it would be inspiring. Inspiring is a powerful word, but here’s the proof: 1300 attendees from 35 countries gathered at one location, and for the very first time the entire Elastic team was united under one roof, creating a unique opportunity to explore insights to search, data analysis and aggregations.

# The Keynote
The conference kicked off with a Keynote where the CEO, Steven Schuurman, and the creator, founder and CTO, Shay Banon, took us on a trip through the history of Elasticsearch after which, they made two big announcements: first Elasticsearch has been rebranded to [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co), and second [Found](https://www.found.no/), the Elasticsearch as a service company has been acquired by Elastic. Elasticsearch will remain as a core product for Elastic, but the new brand will encompass the broader scope of their suite of products and services.

# Elastic{ON} had three main tracks

#### Track 1 - ELK in the Wild (A track dedicated to companies sharing how they are using Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana)

By far this was the most popular track due to presentations given by companies like Cisco, USGS, Mozilla, Verizon, Yale, Github, Wikimedia, Yelp, Fico, Netflix and Zendesk among others. It was literally standing room only or no room at all. A couple of presentations I was able to squeeze in:  

1) **”Tectonic Shifts, Tweets, & Tactical Data Analysis”** [presented by Michelle Guy from USGS](https://www.elastic.co/elasticon/2015/sf/tectonic-shifts-tweets-and-tactical-data-analysis/?view=1)

>> Apparently, instrument based earthquake monitoring systems may take up to 10 minutes to broadcast information regarding the epicenter of an earthquake. USGS has a project currently in Beta which analyzes tweet trends during seismic activity which has reduced the feedback loop to less than 2 minutes. The tweet data is geocoded and put into Elasticsearch, a pretty map in a Kibana dashboard does the rest. How cool is that?


2) **”Scaling Elasticsearch for Production at Verizon: 500 Billion Documents & Counting”** [presented by Bhaskar Karambelkar from Verizon](https://www.elastic.co/elasticon/2015/sf/scaling-elasticsearch-for-production-at-verizon/?view=1)

>> Doesn't the title say it all? Amazing talk! What to do, and more importantly, what not to do from a company that is indexing over 10 billion entry logs daily, and with an impressive 500 billion plus documents to date. [Definitely check out the video](https://www.elastic.co/elasticon/2015/sf/scaling-elasticsearch-for-production-at-verizon/?view=1)

#### Track 2 - Developer track (Inside look at what's coming up in Elastic)

Elastic engineers are really passionate about their products and were eager to share. This track was full of insights and lessons learned from the team. What’s coming up? Improvements to Elasticsearch 2.x, a lot of the things we don’t see. More graphs and better filters for Kibana as well as more reliability for Logstash. If you are looking for a technical flavor check out this track talks.

#### Track 3 - Demo theater (Demos and more demos)

One of my favorite talks in this track was [“Life of a document in Elasticsearh”](https://www.elastic.co/elasticon/2015/sf/elasticsearch-data-journey-life-of-a-document-in-elasticsearch/?view=1). When you put a document in an index, you get back a 200. But how, when and where is the document stored? This talk gave me a better understanding of how Elasticsearch works under the hood.

### Birds of Feathers
On day two, in addition to the main tracks, we broke into small QA sessions called “Birds of feathers”. Very casual chats, yet extremely informative.

# My favorite: THE ASK ME ANYTHING BOOTH!!
Elastic{ON} version of the Apple genius bar. Elastic engineers and staff were ready to answer all the questions we had. Next year they should call it “Ask me everything” because that’s what we did!

# Closing remarks
Every person I spoke to seemed very inspired by the conference. I think a big part of it was the tremendous effort put into creating an environment for people to learn and share before, during and after the conference. So to the entire Elastic team, I say thank you for a wonderful experience and looking forward to next year!
